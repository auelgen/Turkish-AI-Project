# Turkish-AI-Project
Turkish artificial intelligence project, NLP and ML algorithms were used.

This repository showcases a natural language processing (NLP) application tailored for Turkish. The project integrates machine learning and AI-powered tools to classify and analyze user input, generate topic summaries, and perform web research while storing results in a PostgreSQL database for further use.
## Features
Text Classification: Using a trained machine learning model and categorizes input text into primary and secondary topics.
Summarization: Leverages advanced NLP techniques to extract meaningful summaries from Turkish text.
Web Search Integration: Automatically fetches search results based on the analyzed topics.
Database Storage: Saves the results (topics and research outputs) into a PostgreSQL database for easy retrieval and analysis.

## Technologies Used
NLP: Spacy with pyTextRank for summarization and text processing.
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn for model training and prediction.
Database: PostgreSQL for structured data storage.
Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup for integrating Google search results.
